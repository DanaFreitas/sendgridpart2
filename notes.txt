I should use res get to get...
    do I set up the html with it 
        OOORRR
    do I use it to get the inputted info
I should use res send to send the info to an email

I had app.get and app.listen crossing wires with each other, which is why the code didnt work


 
 app.get('/', (req, res) => {
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });



I figured out path. I use() to set up the route I will want to take. if its direct, use __dirname
    dont forget express.static

Then, I will  use res.send to sedn out the static site 

What I need to do next is to be able to declare variables for the static inputs
I also need a way for the progrma to be able to access them.

module.export tells you what to export from another file
    module.exports = divisor
require will import the thing from the other file
    const divisor = require('./declaration.js')


I need to have a way to record inputs

Try having the values based on sendform...will likely need to know "proper order" to have code  
    i suspect it will run in app.js and the first thing will be to import the values from declaration.js


7/3

Body parser is what is needed for processing info from an http request body

action vs onsubmit 
    omsubmit runs js that effects the client
        if dont want a preload, will need preventdefault
    action sends the info to a server
        will reload the page

action="url" is the location where the backend code takes place

I dont think I need a template engine 

const app = express();


I  need to check the site. HAve way to print what was encoded
rember the console log does to the terminal. not the livesercer

req.body helps 
    it can define the inputs, like in the console.log
